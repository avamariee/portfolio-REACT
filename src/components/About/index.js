                        Hello, and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Ava Bullock, and I'm a Full Stack Web Developer.
                            <br></br>When I'm not coding up a storm, I enjoy playing story-driven video games, playing with my cats, and cooking!
                            <br></br>If you'd like to see the projects I've worked on, please select the "Portfolio" tab above!
                            I look forward to working with you. â™¥
